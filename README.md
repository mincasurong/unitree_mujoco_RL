![Unitree Robotics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco/main/docs/unitree_logo.png)

This repository is a customized version of the original [Unitree MuJoCo Simulator](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco), extended to integrate Reinforcement Learning capabilities and advanced control for the Unitree GO2 robot. The primary goal of this project is to develop and simulate control and reinforcement learning algorithms for the Unitree GO2 robot using MuJoCo, ROS2, and Python.

## Features

- **MuJoCo Integration**: The simulator uses MuJoCo for realistic physics simulation of the Unitree GO2 robot.
- **ROS2 Compatibility**: ROS2 nodes have been added for real-time interaction between the simulation and control algorithms.
- **Reinforcement Learning Ready**: Extends the simulation environment to work seamlessly with reinforcement learning frameworks.
- **Advanced Motion Control**: Implement advanced motion testing using various control commands such as velocity control, balance control, and trajectory following.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone this repository and install the dependencies:
